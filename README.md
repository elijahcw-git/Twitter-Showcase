## Summary

This is a complex application used to authenticate to Twitter using a bearer token and to retrieve tweets to display to the front end. The project uses a Flask Python server to make API endpoint GET requests in order to retrieve the needed data. Each request to the Twitter API requires authentication and the returned data is very complex. After retrieving the data from the Flask server and sending it to the React.JS front end, the data is much easier to parse into the necessary fields to create the proper tweet format. There are many moving parts to this project and conditional logic that will determine which endpoint a user reaches. This allows them to search for a specific user or search for tweets by a text-string. The random tweet generator randomly selects from a hard coded array of my favorite twitter users and displays a random tweet from their timeline.
